# Lab5: Read/Write data on EEPROM and ADC/DAC
## Goal:
Use Motorola 68k softcore process on DE1-SoC FPGA Board, 
1. Set up I2C Controller so that I2C controller can read/write from I2C slave devices. This is done by setting Control, Transmit, Receive, Command, Status Registers for Wishbond Buses. 
2. Write the firmware for EEPROM's read/write
3. Write the firmware for ADC/DAC's read/write
## Specification:
* EEProm : Microchip24AA1025, 128k bytes EEProm
* ADC/DAC: PCF8591
## To run:
Can't run this File. This is just the firmware file.
